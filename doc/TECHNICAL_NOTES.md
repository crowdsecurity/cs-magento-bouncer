## CrowdSec Bouncer PHP Library

This extension is mainly based on the CrowdSec Bouncer PHP library. It is an open source library whose code you can find
[here](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/php-cs-bouncer).

## Full Page Cache

In Magento 2, the full page cache is implemented via a plugin on the front controller (`vendor/magento/module-page-cache/Model/App/FrontController/BuiltinPlugin.php::aroundDispatch`).

As we want to check IPs before this FPC process, we use also an `aroundDispatch` plugin, and we adjust the `sortOrder` so that
the CrowdSec_Bouncer plugin is called before the FPC plugin:

- In `vendor/crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer/etc/frontend/di.xml` we change the `sortOrder` of the Magento FPC plugin.
- In `vendor/crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer/etc/di.xml` we declare our plugin with a lower `sortOrder`.

Note that our plugin acts on every Magento areas while the FPC plugin is just active on the frontend area.

## Varnish

This extension works with a Varnish cached Magento 2 instance but, as the cached content of page are delivered by
Varnish itself, we adopt the following strategy :

- If the first visit of a non cached page comes from a bad IP, we display the captcha or ban wall, but we do not add
  this
  content to the cache. See `vendor/crowdsec/magento2-module-bouncer/Model/Bouncer.php::sendResponse`.

- If the first visit of a non cached page comes from a clean IP, we let it pass, so Magento will cache the content
  as usual. As a result, if a bad IP user visits this page after the clean IP one, he will see the cached content.

## Magento 2.2

As Magento 2.2 is not compatible with PHP 7.2 until [2.2.9](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.2.9/composer.json#L11) and has reached end of support in [2019](https://devdocs.magento.com/release/released-versions.html#22), we did not try to make this extension compatible with it.

## Why `crowdsec/magento-symfony-cache` ?

The [Magento 2 `CrowdSec_Bouncer` module](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/cs-magento-bouncer/) depends on the
[CrowdSec PHP library `crowdsec/bouncer`](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/php-cs-bouncer) that comes with
`symfony/cache` as dependency (`v5` or `v6`).
With Magento `2.4.4` and `2.4.5`, a fresh installation on PHP 8 will lock a `3.0.0` version of `psr/cache`.
And it will also install a `v2.2.11` version of `web-token/jwt-framework` that locks a `v4.4.45` version of
`symfony/http-kernel`.

As a `v5` version of `symfony/cache` required `^1.0|^2.0` version of `psr/cache`, and a `v6` version of
`symfony/cache` conflicts with `symfony/http-kernel` <5.4, it is impossible to require any version of the
`symfony/cache` package.

That's why we needed to create a fork of `symfony/cache` that we called `crowdsec/magento-symfony-cache`.

The `v1` version of `crowdsec/magento-symfony-cache` only requires some specific `5.x.y` version of `symfony/cache`
and is only available for PHP < `8.0.2`.

For PHP >= `8.0.2`, we provide a compatible `v2` version of
`crowdsec/magento-symfony-cache`.
The `v2` version replaces the specified `5.x.y` version of `symfony/cache` : we use a copy of `5.x.y` files and
allow `psr/cache` `3.0`. We also copy some `6.0.z` files to have compatible PHP 8 method signatures.

Since Magento `2.4.6`, it is possible to install `symfony/cache` without this dependency hell. That's why we provide
an alternative `v3` version that is just a mirror of `symfony/cache`. Whenever it is possible, composer will pick up this version and just use the original `symfony/cache` package.
